===================================
Implementation of a theoretical connectivity algorithm in Java

Software Dependencies
---------------------
* Java Development Kit (version 1.7.0_95 or greater) from [here](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html)

Usage
------------------
* go to bin dictionary
* double click seniorproject.jar
* click Browse to select input file and algorithm(in_smallGPS.txt and inGPS.txt are for GPS algorithm, minMATLAB.txt is for MATLAB algorithm)
* click button(Run) to execute algorithm
* click button(Graph) to plot graph
* our code will generate output.png automatically



Known Issues
------------
* Kruskal's algorithm option has a few edge cases that sometimes causes inaccurate results
